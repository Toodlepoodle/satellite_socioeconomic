üõ∞Ô∏è Data Sources Used

VIIRS Nighttime Lights ‚Üí Economic indicators
Sentinel-2 ‚Üí Housing, vegetation, road quality
Sentinel-1 SAR ‚Üí Building structure, informal settlements
Sentinel-5P ‚Üí Air pollution (NO2)
WorldPop ‚Üí Population density, market access
Global Surface Water ‚Üí Water access
SRTM DEM ‚Üí Terrain isolation
Distance calculations ‚Üí Hospital, airport access



Here's a detailed breakdown of each satellite data source and how it's used for poverty analysis:

üåô VIIRS Nighttime Lights ‚Üí Economic Indicators
What it is: NASA/NOAA satellite that captures visible and near-infrared light at night
GEE Dataset: 'NOAA/VIIRS/DNB/MONTHLY_V1/VCMSLCFG'
How it works for poverty:

Bright areas = Economic activity, electricity access, wealth
Dark areas = No electricity, economic isolation, poverty
Scientific basis: Strong correlation between nighttime lights and GDP per capita

Specific indicators extracted:
python# Economic poverty indicators from darkness
electrification_deficit = max(0, 1 - ntl_mean)  # Less light = more poverty
extreme_poverty_ratio = 1.0 if ntl_p10 < 0.1 else 0.0  # Very dark areas
economic_isolation_index = max(0, 1 - ntl_median)  # Economic isolation

üõ∞Ô∏è Sentinel-2 ‚Üí Housing, Vegetation, Road Quality
What it is: European Space Agency optical satellite with 13 spectral bands, 10m resolution
GEE Dataset: 'COPERNICUS/S2_SR_HARMONIZED'
How it works for poverty:
Housing Quality Analysis:

Metal roofs = Higher NIR reflectance ‚Üí Better housing
Thatch/organic roofs = Higher red, lower NIR ‚Üí Poor housing
Concrete roofs = Specific spectral signature

python# Roof material detection
metal_roof_index = NIR_band / Red_band  # Higher = metal roofs
organic_roof_index = Red_band / NIR_band  # Higher = poor materials

Vegetation Health (NDVI):

High NDVI = Healthy vegetation, better environment
Low NDVI = Degraded land, poor living conditions

pythonndvi = (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)
vegetation_deficit = max(0, 0.3 - ndvi_mean)  # Low vegetation = poverty

Road Quality:

Paved roads = Higher SWIR reflectance
Unpaved roads = Higher visible, lower SWIR

pythonpaved_road_index = SWIR_band / Red_band
road_quality_deficit = unpaved_ratio / paved_ratio

üì° Sentinel-1 SAR ‚Üí Building Structure, Informal Settlements
What it is: Synthetic Aperture Radar that penetrates clouds, works day/night
GEE Dataset: 'COPERNICUS/S1_GRD'
How it works for poverty:

SAR backscatter reveals building density and structure patterns
Regular structures = Formal settlements, better planning
Irregular structures = Informal settlements, slums

python# Building analysis from radar
urban_density = VV_band - VH_band  # Building density
structure_quality = VV_band / VH_band  # Building regularity
informal_settlement_index = max(0, 1 - structure_quality)  # Irregular = informal
Why SAR is valuable: Can detect building materials, density, and settlement patterns that optical sensors miss

üå´Ô∏è Sentinel-5P ‚Üí Air Pollution (NO2)
What it is: Atmospheric monitoring satellite measuring trace gases
GEE Dataset: 'COPERNICUS/S5P/NRTI/L3_NO2'
How it works for poverty:

High NO2 = Industrial pollution, traffic, poor air quality
Environmental poverty: Poor communities often live in polluted areas
Health impacts: Air pollution correlates with poverty and health outcomes

python# Air pollution burden
no2_density = NO2_column_number_density
air_pollution_burden = min(1.0, max(0, no2_density * 1e6))
Poverty connection: Environmental justice - poor communities disproportionately exposed to pollution

üë• WorldPop ‚Üí Population Density, Market Access
What it is: High-resolution population distribution maps using census + satellite data
GEE Dataset: 'WorldPop/GP/100m/pop'
How it works for poverty:
Population Patterns:

Very high density = Overcrowding, slums
Very low density = Isolation, poor access
Population inequality = Mixed formal/informal settlements

python# Population-based poverty indicators
overcrowding_index = min(1.0, pop_density / 10000)  # Normalize by 10k/km¬≤
population_inequality = pop_std / pop_mean  # High inequality = slums
Market Access:

Surrounding population = Economic opportunities, markets
More people nearby = Better market access, jobs, services

python# Market access from population
surrounding_pop = population_sum_within_10km
market_access_score = min(1.0, surrounding_pop / 50000)

üíß Global Surface Water ‚Üí Water Access
What it is: Maps showing where water has been detected over 30+ years
GEE Dataset: 'JRC/GSW1_4/GlobalSurfaceWater'
How it works for poverty:

Distance to water = Basic need access
Reliable water sources = Areas with >50% water occurrence over time
Water poverty: Far from reliable water = higher poverty risk

python# Water access analysis
reliable_water = water_occurrence > 50%  # Reliable water sources
water_distance = distance_to_reliable_water
water_access_deficit = min(1.0, water_distance / 5000)  # Normalize by 5km
Poverty connection: Water access is fundamental - long distances = time burden, especially for women

üèîÔ∏è SRTM DEM ‚Üí Terrain Isolation
What it is: Shuttle Radar Topography Mission - global elevation data
GEE Dataset: 'USGS/SRTMGL1_003'
How it works for poverty:

Steep terrain = Geographic isolation, poor road access
High slopes = Difficult transportation, service delivery
Terrain barriers = Economic isolation

python# Terrain-based isolation
slope = calculate_slope_from_elevation
terrain_isolation = min(1.0, mean_slope / 15.0)  # Normalize by 15 degrees
geographic_isolation = 1.0 if mean_slope > 10 else 0.0
Poverty connection: Mountainous/hilly areas often have poor infrastructure access, isolated communities

üìä How These Combine for Comprehensive Poverty Analysis
Each data source captures a different dimension of poverty:

VIIRS ‚Üí Economic activity/electricity
Sentinel-2 ‚Üí Living conditions, environment, infrastructure
Sentinel-1 ‚Üí Settlement patterns, housing structure
Sentinel-5P ‚Üí Environmental health
WorldPop ‚Üí Social patterns, market access
Global Surface Water ‚Üí Basic needs access
SRTM ‚Üí Geographic barriers


üìä Step 2: Dimension Score Calculation

                          0.25 √ó informal_settlement_index + 
                          0.25 √ó water_access_deficit + 
                          0.25 √ó severe_water_shortage)

                       0.30 √ó environmental_degradation + 
                       0.20 √ó green_space_deprivation + 
                       0.20 √ó air_pollution_burden)
Access Deprivation Score (NEW)
python# Distance calculations first
hospital_access_deficit = min(1.0, distance_to_major_city_km / 50.0)
airport_access_deficit = min(1.0, distance_to_airport_km / 100.0)
market_access_score = min(1.0, surrounding_population_10km / 50000)
market_access_deficit = 1 - market_access_score

# Road quality from Sentinel-2
paved_road_index = B11_SWIR / B4_Red
unpaved_road_index = B4_Red / B11_SWIR
road_quality_deficit = min(1.0, unpaved_road_index / max(paved_road_index, 0.1))

# Combine access indicators
Access_Score = (0.30 √ó hospital_access_deficit + 
                0.20 √ó airport_access_deficit + 
                0.30 √ó market_access_deficit + 
                0.20 √ó road_quality_deficit)
Connectivity Isolation Score (NEW)
python# Same as access but different weighting
healthcare_isolation_index = hospital_access_deficit
transportation_isolation = airport_access_deficit
economic_opportunities_index = market_access_score  # Higher = better, so invert

Connectivity_Score = (0.40 √ó healthcare_isolation_index + 
                      0.30 √ó transportation_isolation + 
                      0.30 √ó (1 - economic_opportunities_index))  # Invert good indicator

üéØ Step 3: Final Enhanced MPI Calculation
Traditional MPI (Literature-based)
pythonTraditional_MPI = (0.33 √ó Economic_Score + 
                   0.33 √ó Living_Standards_Score + 
                   0.34 √ó Environmental_Score)
Enhanced MPI (With New Access Dimensions)
pythonEnhanced_MPI = (0.25 √ó Economic_Score + 
                0.25 √ó Living_Standards_Score + 
                0.25 √ó Environmental_Score + 
                0.15 √ó Access_Score + 
                0.10 √ó Connectivity_Score)

üîÑ Step 4: Normalization and Classification
Ensure 0-1 Scale
python# All individual indicators normalized to 0-1 where 1 = maximum poverty
normalized_indicator = min(1.0, max(0.0, raw_value))

pythonif Enhanced_MPI < 0.33:
    poverty_level = "Low"
elif Enhanced_MPI < 0.66:
    poverty_level = "Moderate"
else:
    poverty_level = "High"
