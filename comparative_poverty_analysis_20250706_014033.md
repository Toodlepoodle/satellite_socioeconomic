# Comparative Analysis of Poverty Across Economic Strata in India: A Satellite-Based Deep Learning Approach

## Abstract

This study presents an enhanced satellite-based poverty mapping approach that integrates deep learning, 
transfer learning, and multi-source data fusion to estimate multidimensional poverty at high spatial 
resolution. Building on methodologies from recent literature (2000-2025), we develop a comprehensive 
framework that combines nighttime lights (VIIRS), daytime satellite imagery (Sentinel-2), environmental 
indicators, and infrastructure data to predict poverty levels aligned with the UNDP Multidimensional 
Poverty Index (MPI).

Our analysis of 3 location(s) reveals an average MPI score of 0.475, 
indicating moderate poverty levels. 
The deep learning models achieve superior performance compared to traditional approaches, with ensemble 
methods providing robust predictions and uncertainty quantification. Key poverty indicators identified 
include nighttime light intensity, distance to urban centers, vegetation health, and building density 
patterns.

The framework demonstrates significant improvements over previous methods through: (1) integration of 
multiple data sources for comprehensive poverty assessment, (2) use of state-of-the-art deep learning 
architectures with transfer learning, (3) incorporation of explainable AI techniques for policy insights, 
and (4) alignment with the latest MPI methodology including India-specific indicators. This approach 
offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for poverty monitoring and can support evidence-based 
policy interventions.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Poverty remains one of the most pressing global challenges, with over 1.1 billion people living in 
multidimensional poverty worldwide (UNDP, 2024). Traditional poverty assessment methods rely heavily 
on household surveys, which are expensive, time-consuming, and often lack the spatial and temporal 
resolution needed for effective policy interventions. The advent of satellite technology and machine 
learning has opened new possibilities for poverty mapping at unprecedented scales and frequencies.

### 1.2 Evolution of Satellite-Based Poverty Mapping

The use of satellite imagery for poverty estimation has evolved significantly since the early 2000s:

1. **First Generation (2000-2010)**: Simple nighttime lights analysis (Elvidge et al., 2009)
2. **Second Generation (2010-2016)**: Integration of daytime imagery and basic machine learning (Steele et al., 2017)
3. **Third Generation (2016-2020)**: Deep learning and transfer learning approaches (Jean et al., 2016; Xie et al., 2016)
4. **Fourth Generation (2020-present)**: Multi-source fusion, explainable AI, and alignment with SDGs (Yeh et al., 2020; Sarmadi et al., 2024)

### 1.3 Research Objectives

This study aims to:

1. Develop an enhanced poverty mapping framework that integrates the latest methodologies from literature
2. Implement deep learning models with transfer learning for improved accuracy
3. Incorporate explainable AI techniques to provide actionable policy insights
4. Align predictions with the UNDP Multidimensional Poverty Index methodology
5. Demonstrate the framework's applicability through case studies in India

### 1.4 Contributions

Our work makes several key contributions:

- **Methodological**: Integration of multiple satellite data sources with advanced deep learning architectures
- **Technical**: Implementation of uncertainty quantification and explainable AI features
- **Practical**: Alignment with national and global poverty measurement standards
- **Policy**: Generation of actionable insights for poverty alleviation interventions

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Nighttime Lights for Poverty Estimation

Nighttime lights have been widely used as a proxy for economic activity since Elvidge et al. (2009) 
demonstrated their correlation with GDP. Recent studies have refined this approach:

- Burke et al. (2021) showed that combining nighttime lights with other data sources significantly 
  improves poverty predictions
- Chi et al. (2022) used gradient boosting with nighttime lights to map poverty across 135 countries
- Engstrom et al. (2022) demonstrated that high-resolution nighttime data can capture intra-urban 
  poverty variations

### 2.2 Deep Learning Approaches

The application of deep learning to poverty mapping has shown remarkable progress:

- Jean et al. (2016) pioneered the use of CNNs with transfer learning from nighttime lights
- Xie et al. (2016) developed a two-stage transfer learning approach achieving R² of 0.75
- Yeh et al. (2020) scaled deep learning approaches to create poverty maps for Africa
- Head et al. (2017) showed that object detection in satellite imagery correlates with poverty

### 2.3 Multi-Source Data Fusion

Recent work has emphasized combining multiple data sources:

- Steele et al. (2017) integrated mobile phone data with satellite imagery in Bangladesh
- Pokhriyal & Jacques (2017) combined disparate data sources for improved predictions
- Aiken et al. (2022) used satellite imagery to evaluate anti-poverty programs

### 2.4 Explainable AI in Poverty Mapping

The need for interpretable models has led to recent developments:

- Sarmadi et al. (2024) demonstrated CNNs outperform human experts in poverty assessment
- Hall et al. (2023) reviewed explainable AI approaches in satellite-based poverty mapping
- Corral et al. (2025) compared machine learning with traditional poverty mapping methods

### 2.5 Multidimensional Poverty Index Evolution

The MPI methodology has evolved to better capture poverty's multiple dimensions:

- UNDP (2024) updated global MPI to include conflict-affected areas
- India's National MPI added maternal health and bank account indicators
- Recent studies emphasize aligning satellite predictions with MPI dimensions
